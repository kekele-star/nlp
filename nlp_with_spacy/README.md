# NLP Project with spaCy and Python

## Overview
This project is aimed at demonstrating the use of spaCy, a powerful natural language processing library in Python, for various NLP tasks such as tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and more. The project includes sample code and explanations for each task.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- spaCy
- [Optional] Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install spaCy using pip:
   ```
   pip install -U spacy
   ```
3. Download the English language model for spaCy:
   ```
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks to explore different NLP tasks.
   ```
   python tokenization.py
   ```
4. Follow the comments and documentation within the scripts to understand each NLP task and the corresponding spaCy usage.

## Files
- `tokenization.py`: Demonstrates tokenization of text using spaCy.
- `ner.py`: Illustrates named entity recognition (NER) using spaCy.
- `pos_tagging.py`: Shows part-of-speech (POS) tagging using spaCy.
- [Optional] Jupyter Notebooks (`tokenization.ipynb`, `ner.ipynb`, `pos_tagging.ipynb`): Provides interactive exploration of NLP tasks.
